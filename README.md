Digital medicine has become an inseparable part of the advanced human society. It provides a holistic sphere of care, cure and management empowered with latest
developments in information technology, sensor design and genomics1. Bacteria-on-a-chip (BaaC) is the most recent and novel inclusion of this era.
The motivation behind such intrinsic hybrid medical approach relies on the current need of real time and pervasive computation for smart healthcare2. In this
approach, a type of synthesized bacterial strain is made useful by responding to a stimulus into a wireless signal. The fundamental mechanism behind
BaaC is the amalgamation of an on-switch DNA coupled with a given code for bacterial bioluminescence. The improved genetic circuit is then associated with the bacteria strain (e.g. Escherichia coli) of the target patient-body (i.e. human, rat, pig, etc.) The whole system is then en- capsulated within a body-safe semiper-
meable membrane, i.e. capsule. Such BaaC is also powered with micro-batteries integrated with a microprocessor assembly to send the perceived signal outside of the
patient-body. Usually such signals are received by smartphone-based apps via wireless Bluetooth communication. Practically, a BaaC module is ingested by the patient. After swallowing, it goes into the gastrointestinal (GI) tract to monitor internal bleeding or infection. When the BaaC capsule comes in contact
with the GI tract, the external fluid goes inside the capsule via the semipermeable membrane through diffusion. When the BaaC module encounters the targeted
blood or infectious molecules, pre engineered strain is triggered automatically. Normally, BaaC induced bacteria strains are placed inside the micro-wells
which are fabricated inside the BaaC capsules. Such filled-in wells emit light when associated with the targeted blood  molecule. Pre-installed photo resistors
receive the emitted light from the wells. The information is then transmitted to the microcontroller for further processing.

A recently developed BaaC consumes less power, i.e. 13 mW and is equipped with 2.7 V battery which is susceptible to  acidic fluid of the GI tract. The BaaC
capsule is 3.81 cm in length and can stay inside the GI tract for about 45 days5. Upon completion of the task, BaaC module is automatically expired inside the GI
tract. Otherwise, the BaaC module get excreted from the body. The advantages of BaaC modules are that they are ingestible, automatic, robust, side effect-free, wireless communication is possible, self or semioperative, suitable for one-time use, capable of real-time signal transmission, can circumvent surgical procedure, can be manifested remotely and cost effective. However, the disadvantages could be possible hack, intrusion, security breach or ethical orientation. Nevertheless, BaaC seems to be the most promising technology that could reshape digital medicine in the near future
